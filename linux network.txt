Linux TCP/IP Network Configuration Files:
File	Description
/etc/resolv.conf	List DNS servers for internet domain name resolution.
                        Manual page for: /etc/resolv.conf
/etc/hosts	        Lists hosts to be resolved locally (not by DNS).
                        Manual page for: /etc/hosts
/etc/nsswitch.conf	List order of host name search. Typically look at local files, then NIS server, then DNS server.
                        Manual page for: /etc/nsswitch.conf
Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS: /etc/sysconfig/network	Specify network configuration. eg. Static IP, DHCP, NIS, etc.
Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-device	Specify TCP network information.
Ubuntu/Debian: /etc/network/interfaces	Specify network configuration and devices. eg. Static IP and info, DHCP, etc.

Routing.

Route command is used to show/manipulate the IP routing table.
 It is primarily used to setup static routes to specific host or networks via an interface
$ route
By default route command displays the host name in its output. We can request it to display the numerical IP address
 using -n option as shown below.
$ route -n
4. Reject Routing to a Particular Host or Network
Sometimes we may want to reject routing the packets to a particular host/network. To do that, add the following entry.

$ route add -host 192.168.1.51 reject

The /etc/resolv.conf is resolver configuration file for Linux and UNIX like operating systems.
It is used to configure dns name servers.
The file /etc/resolv.conf file contains information that is read by the resolver routines the first time they are invoked by a process.
The file is designed to be human readable and contains a list of keywords with values that provide various types of resolver information.
You need to update this file with your own caching dns server or ISPs caching dns server that you want to use the resolver should query.
You can view this file with cat command itself:
cat /etc/resolv.conf
Sample outputs:

nameserver 10.0.80.11
nameserver 10.0.80.12

sysctl is an interface that allows you to make changes to a running Linux kernel. With /etc/sysctl.conf you can configure various
 Linux networking and system settings such as:
 Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv4
Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv6
Turn on execshield protection
Prevent against the common ‘syn flood attack’
Turn on source IP address verification
Prevents a cracker from using a spoofing attack against the IP address of the server.
Logs several types of suspicious packets, such as spoofed packets, source-routed packets, and redirects.

Purpose of bashrc file:

You can export environment variables(So there is no need to export environment variable every time)
You can define aliases
You can provide the path for cross compiler
You can add your own script which can start automatically whenever new shell is opened.
You can change the history length

netstat — Print information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
yum install net-tools 
netsat -lntp

proc file system in Linux
It contains the useful information about the processes that are currently running, it is regarded as control and information centre for kernel.
The proc file system also provides communication medium between kernel space and user space
ls -l /proc
